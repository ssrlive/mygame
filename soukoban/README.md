A library provides the implementation of algorithms and data structures related to [Sokoban].

## Features

- **Level**
  - **Zero-allocation lazy parsing**: Parses levels lazily from an in-memory string without memory allocations except for level creation.
  - **Lazy stream parsing**: Parses levels lazily from a stream.
  - **Map reconstruction**: Reconstructs the map from the solution.
  - **Normalization**: Removes elements from the map that are not relevant to the solution.
  - **RLE support**: Enables loading of levels encoded in Run-Length Encoding (RLE) format.
- **Solution**
  - **Reversal move handling**: Automatically interprets reversal moves as undo actions.
  - **Metrics calculation**: Computes metrics such as `box_lines`, `box_changes`, `pushing_sessions`, and `player_lines`.
- **Pathfinding**: Finds the optimal player path to push a box to a position.
- **Deadlock detection**: Detects static deadlocks and freeze deadlocks.
